After submitting, navigate to the course public folder (courses > software-studio > 2025-spring > lab-flutter-basics-dart-expense-tracker-app), and click on 'Merge Requests' on the left. Search for your student ID and check your merge request. Confirm that 'Request to merge (your student ID: your branch) into (your student ID)' is displayed, where (**your branch**) should usually be **master**, and 'into (**your student ID**)' should show your own **student ID**.
